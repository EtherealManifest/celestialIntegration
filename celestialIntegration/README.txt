##README
This is a sample site that usses flask. It is heavily based on the flask tutorial, and
makes use of a login and a blog system.
The base folder for this project is CelestialIntegration. the name has little to do with the
content of this project, but it does sound cool.

start by downloading the project. Then, in the terminal, navigate to the folder the project
is located in on your computer. in the terminal, run
   pip install -r requirements. txt
to install all the required packages. next, enter the command
   flask --app celestialIntegration run
to establish the development server. go to the link that is generated (should be http://127.0.0.1:5000/)
and you're in! Login or register, and add posts as needed! this isnt an active server, but it is a fun
experiment in Flask and bootstrap!
